# Question 1 : Write a Dart program that:
1- Reads two numbers (assign directly for simplicity).<br>
2- Checks if either is odd and the other is even, or both are positive (using &&, ||).<br>
3- Uses ++ and -- to increment the first and decrement the second.
4- Casts one result to an integer (toInt()).<br>
5- Applies the bitwise NOT ~ to the first number after casting.<br>
6- Prints true if the incremented first number is greater than the decremented second, using a conditional operator.

# Question 2 : Write a Dart function that:
1- Takes a double number (e.g., num = 12.7).<br>
2- Prints the ceiling, floor, and rounded values.<br>
3- Concatenates the number as a string with a given name (e.g., "Value: 12.7").<br>
4- Uses ? : to print "Large" if the number is above 10, otherwise "Small".


# Question 3 : Write Dart code that:
1- Declares a constant list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].<br>
2- Converts the list to a set and adds the value 12.<br>
3- Creates a map where keys are from the set and values are the numbers multiplied by 3.<br>
4- Prints the map.

# Question 4 : Write a Dart program that:
1- Reads a number of days.<br>
2- Converts days to years (1 year = 365 days), months (1 month = 30 days) and reset days.<br>
3- Prints all results.<br>

### Sample output : 

400   days =>   Years: 1 , Months: 1 , Days: 5
