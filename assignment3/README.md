# Question 1 : IF Statement – Voting Eligibility 
Write a program that asks the user to input their age.<br>
* If the age is 18 or older, print: "You are eligible to vote."<br>
* Otherwise, print: "You are not eligible to vote yet."

* Each number should be printed on a new line.

When the correct password is entered, print: "Access granted."

# Question 4 : IF-ELIF-ELSE – Grade Classification
Write a program that asks the user to enter their exam score (0–100), and then prints a message based on the score:<br><br>
1- 90 and above → "Excellent! You got an A."<br>
2- 80 to 89 → "Very Good! You got a B."<br>
3- 70 to 79 → "Good! You got a C."<br>
4- Below 70 → "You need improvement. You got a D."

# Question 5 : SWITCH-CASE – Day of the Week
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number from 1 to 7, and prints the corresponding day:
* 1 -> Sunday<br>
* 2 -> Monday<br>
* 3 -> Tuesday<br>
* 4 -> Wednesday<br>
* 5 -> Thursday<br>
* 6 -> Friday<br>
* 7 -> Saturday<br>
* Any other number -> "Invalid input."

# Question 6 : Advanced IF-ELSE – Login and Access Control System
Write a program that simulates a simple login and access control system.<br><br>
The user is asked to enter:<br>
1- Username<br>
2- Password<br>
3- Role (either "admin" or "user").<br>

Based on the input:<br>
1- If the username is "manager" and the password is "admin@123" and the role is "admin" → print: "Welcome Admin Manager! Full access granted."<br>
2- If the username is "manager" and the password is correct but the role is not "admin" → print: "Access denied: Admin role required."<br>
3- If the username is "guest" and the password is "user@123" and role is "user" → print: "Welcome Guest! Limited access granted."<br>
4- If the password is wrong → print: "Incorrect password. Try again."<br>
5- If the username is not recognized → print: "Unknown user."
